        <h2 id="loops">What is the difference between a ‘for’, ‘while’ and ‘do while’ loop?</h2>
        <p>	Loops are crucial tools for repeating tasks, cycling through blocks of code, and all sorts of other tricks. Some loops are better suited for situations than others, though. A while loop is best for when you may or may not want a block of code to run, or to continue running. A do-while loop is great when you want a block of code to run once, and possibly more. A for loop is good for when you want a block of code to run a set number of times.</p>
        <p>	Starting with ‘while’, we begin the loop by saying: while(<em>a condition is true</em>){ run this code block } until it’s not true anymore. For example, if I had an Int n that changed every time the code in a while loop was executed, and the condition for this loop was while(n < 10), the code in the loop would keep on repeating until n was greater than nine.</p>
        <p>	A do-while loop is similar, but instead of beginning with: while(<em>a condition is true</em>), the loop starts with: do{ this block of code } and ends with: while(<em>a condition is true</em>). This means that the code in curly brackets will always run at least once, since the condition is not checked until after the first iteration. The condition for a plain while loop might be false the first time around so the code in curly brackets would be skipped all together—this won’t happen with a do-while loop.</p>
        <p>	Unlike the previous loops, a for loop is specialized for executing code a definite number of times. It usually relies on a single ‘loop control variable’ and is made up of three parts: the <em>initiation statement</em> that tells the variable where to start, the <em>condition</em> that must be true in order to continue looping, and the <em>update statement</em> that changes the variable with each iteration. For instance, the loop: for( i = 0 ; i <10 ; i++){… will run the code in curly braces exactly ten times, since after the tenth iteration i = 10 which fails the condition.</p>

        <h2 id="libraries">What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code?</h2>
        <p> Adding the line ‘import java.util.Scanner’ at the beginning of a java file allows us to get information from other files, the internet, and even human beings via the keyboard. This is possible by defining a “Scanner object”, which may subsequently be used to call methods from the Scanner class, such as .next(), .nextInt(), or .nextDouble().</p>
        <p>	All this functionality was written by some smart folks at Oracle a long time ago, and made public as optional packages that anyone can access and include in their own programs. There are hundreds of other built-in Java “libraries” that are free to use, and thousands more written by other programmers. However, only built-in libraries begin with ‘java.’—libraries written by other programmers must use a different name.</p>

        <h2 id="void">What is ‘void’ in a method declaration?</h2>
        <p>	Methods are used to make code more compact, allowing us to call a block of code by its method name instead of typing the same thing again and again. Some methods are only used to execute code without producing a result used by the main method. For instance, a method that prints out “hello world!” does not return any usable information to the main code block, it just prints a statement to the console. In this case it is a “void” method, since it does not <em>return</em> any data back to the main code block. This method might begin like: public static <strong>void</strong> helloWorld( ){…</p>
        <p>	By contrast, a method that does return data to the main method is not void, and must specify the type of data that is to be returned. Perhaps instead of just printing “hello world” I write a program that selects a character at random from the String of characters in “hello world”, then feeds that character back to the main code block. In this case the method would be written: public static <strong>char</strong> helloWorld( ){… This method would also need to include a return statement specifying which character would be fed back into the main program. For example, ‘return c;’ where ‘c’ is a variable that holds the character chosen at random from “hello world”.</p>
