        <h2 id="loops">What is the difference between a ‘for’, ‘while’ and ‘do while’ loop?</h2><br>
        <p>	Loops are crucial tools for repeating tasks, cycling through blocks of code, and all sorts of other tricks. Some loops are better suited for situations than others, though. A while loop is best for when you may or may not want a block of code to run, or to continue running. A do-while loop is great when you want a block of code to run once, and possibly more. A for loop is good for when you want a block of code to run a certain number of times.</p><br>
        <p>	Starting with ‘while’, we begin the loop by saying: while(<em>a condition is true</em>){ run this code block} until it’s not true anymore. For example, if I had an Int n that changed every time the code in a while loop was executed, and the condition for this loop was while(n < 10), the code in the loop would keep on repeating until n was greater than nine.</p><br>
        <p>	A do-while loop is similar, but instead of beginning with: while(<em>a condition is true</em>), the loop starts with: do{ this block of code } and ends with: while(<em>a condition is true</em>). This means that the code in curly brackets will always run at least once, since the condition is not checked until after the first iteration. The condition for a plain while loop might be false the first time around so the code in curly brackets would be skipped all together—this won’t happen with a do-while loop.</p><br>
        <p>	Unlike the previous loops, a for loop is specialized for executing code a definite number of times. It usually relies on a single ‘loop control variable’ and is made up of three parts: the *initiation statement* that tells the variable where to start, the *condition* that must be true in order to continue looping, and the *update statement* that changes the variable with each iteration. For instance, the loop: for( i = 0 ; i <10 ; i++){… will run the code in curly braces exactly ten times, since after the tenth iteration i = 10 which fails the condition.</p><br>
